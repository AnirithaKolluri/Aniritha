<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0nica/M0nica/master/gh-header-image-cropped.png" alt="banner that says Monica Powell - software engineer, content creator and community organizer alongside a cartoon illustration of Monica">

I'm an **AI & ML practitioner** and a **final-year B.Tech student** at **SR University**, specializing in **Computer Science (AI & ML)**. My passion lies in crafting **real-time solutions** through intelligent systems, and exploring the power of **data-driven decision making**.

Currently, I'm an intern at **HCDS Technologies**, where I apply my skills in **Python**, **web development**, and **machine learning** to develop practical, impactful projects.  

I’ve built and contributed to a variety of real-world applications, blending both technical depth and creative problem solving. With a strong foundation in AI, I enjoy bridging the gap between code and real-world use cases.
